# Core Principles

## No Broken Windows

Also known as software rot or technical debt, broken windows in software can mean anything that is bad, from bad design to wrong decisions, code that doesn't follow conventions or good practices. The more time passes, the harder it is to fix them. The bigger problem with broken windows is that they encourage more bad behaviors until they become the norm.

The mindset of 'no broken windows' means that we won't accept them anymore. This means that we'll go in and fix them right away, plan it for the upcoming sprint or at a minimum add a note in code to flag the bad practice so that it's not repeated. 

We need to call these out at planning (_hey I know we have a broken window in there, let's plan for some extra time and fix it since we're there_) or during code reviews in order to make sure we're not introducing new technical debt.

This concept has been introduced in the [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition) book and summarized in [this](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/software-entropy) article.


## Grow Through Code Reviews 

Code Review is a useful tool for growing both from the perspective of software quality
