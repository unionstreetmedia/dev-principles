# Core Principles

Anything that is "core" to our beliefs or really you don't know where else to put goes in here. We can always move things around later.

## Use accepted by community tools and libraries

Prefer to use tools and libraries that are widespread over the community for your language, framework, etc.
Community accepted tools, libraries are usually well documented, tested, and receive updates/fixes more frequently. 
Also, you can get help from the community easier and faster when a tool is commonly used in the community.
Any developer who will work with your project in the future might need to learn new tools and it's a way easier with good documentation and reach the community.
