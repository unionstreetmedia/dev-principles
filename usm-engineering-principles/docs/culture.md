## Code as Craft 
Software craftsmanship, or “code as craft”, has been the subject of debate for years. It even has its own [manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/). 

While we respect that all perspectives on the subject have merit, we believe software development should be approached more as a craft than art or science for the following reasons:
* Software is not based on a finite set of rules, or it would be considered science
* Software is intended to be both beautiful and functional, or it would be considered art
* It is possible to master the craft and still have room to improve

Despite our belief that software is craft it is not the cornerstone of our engineering culture. Rather, we view craftsmanship part of a larger focus on *engineering excellence*.
