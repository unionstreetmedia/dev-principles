## Saying yes

As professionals we are not required to say yes to everything that is asked of us. However, we should work hard to find creative ways to make "yes" possible.

Making yes possible means understanding what the root goal or reason for the request is and making that happen rather than saying yes to the initial request. Getting to yes can mean saying no first. Or saying 'Yes, and...' and drilling into a solution that is feasible and satisfactory on both parties.

When we say yes, we mean it and then we follow through. When we say yes we use the language of commitment so there is no doubt about what we've promised.
