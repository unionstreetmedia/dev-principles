The Engineering Principles is a living collection of information about the engineering principles and culture of Union Street Media. 

These should reflect our collective values that are important to us now. We want to hold ourselves accountable to these principles in order to make sure we're growing as engineers, producing the best quality software and also enjoy coming into work everyday.

## Logistics

This site is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/unionstreetmedia/dev-principles).

Contributions are made via pull requests. 1 principle per pull request. We take a democratic approach and each PR is open for debate and shall be voted on:

- Approve PR with comments if you:
    - Totally agree
    - Don't really agree but you're willing to try it
- Reject PR with comments if you:
    - Are totally opposed and this principle comes against your personal beliefs. We need to talk more about it!

## Principle Template

This is a template that can be copied and pasted for a principle. The first paragraph is a short, memorable description of what the principle stands for.

### Rationale

Explain in more depth why this is important to us and what the implications are.

### Examples

We engineers work better with concrete examples. Give one or more relevant examples of this principle in practice and/or it being broken.
