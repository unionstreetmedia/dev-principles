# Use Descriptive Names and Comments

Classes, functions, and methods are given descriptive comments to describe use case and include
expected inputs and outputs.

Good naming conventions should be used for methods, variables, parameters and classes.

Descriptive comments should never replace good naming conventions for methods, variables,
parameters or classes. When used in conjunction someone new to the codebase should be able to use
existing code without stepping though every line of the method.

## Self-documenting Code
Self-documenting code involves writing code that clearly communicates its purpose and functionality, reducing the need
for extensive documentation. However, this doesn't mean comments should be eliminated entirely. Striking a balance is
key.

Before adding comments, consider whether the code can be further refined to enhance clarityâ€”this might include using more
descriptive names, breaking down functions into smaller, more focused units, or supplementing with more unit tests. Once
the code is as clear as possible, comments should focus on explaining the intent or the underlying rationale behind the
implementation.

Together, the code and comments should provide a comprehensive understanding of how the system works and the reasons
behind its design.

## Good Example:

```
/**
* Schema module for use with MinimalListings objects, ex List View. Constructs JSON-LD structure to
* describe a listing (physical traits) or a listing related event (open house).
*
* @param object $listing | Intakes an object of MinimalListing
* @param object $type | Intakes an enumerated type to determine what is being described.
* Ex: physical, openHouse
*
* @return none | Echos output schema content directly to DOM
**/
private function renderMinimalSchemaListing( \RealEstate\MinimalListing $listing, SchemaType $type) {}
```

## Bad Example:

```
private function renderSchemaListingMinimal( \RealEstate\MinimalListing $l, int $t) {}
```
