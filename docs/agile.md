# Agile Principles

## Agile is more important than scrum (or kanban. or any framework)

[Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is defined as a set of four values, supplemented by twelve principles. These values and principles make no mention of process, ceremonies or productivity tools.

As such, it is possible to be agile without using scrum. It's also possible to use scrum without being the least bit agile. Many companies fall into this trap. We try to avoid it.
