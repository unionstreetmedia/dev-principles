# Use Automatic Code Formatters

Consistently formatted code:
- is cleaner and easier to read
- allows you to focus on the content
- makes reviews faster and more prone to contain meaningful comments

Running automatic code formatters makes keeping code clean easy. There is less to no manual
editing. Code formatters can be set up to run easily at various times. For example, running code
formatters on commit maintains consistency without the developer having to remember to run the
formatter.

## Use Code Analyzers Early

It is much easier to start a new project with a formatter in place from the beginning than it is to
add it on later.

However, any code formatting or analysis is better than none, so adding an automatic formatter
should be done if not already implemented. Start small and iterate.

## Use Code Analyzers Frequently

By running code analyzers and formatters automatically on Pull Request submission, the code changed
in the submission is guaranteed to comply with the formatting spec. This keeps the repository clean
and consistent every time a change is made.
