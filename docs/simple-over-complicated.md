# Simple Over Complicated

The idea of this concept is **not** that systems should never be complex, but that we should favor the simple approach whenever possible and only add complexity when it's necessary. Sometimes the benefits, like making code more extendable, outweighs the cost of the complexity it adds.

Some things to remember:
* Start with the simplest approach.
* Sometimes the best code is no code.
* Try to avoid premature optimization.
* Use design patterns to solve real needs instead of imagined ones.
* If you suspect that something is slow, donâ€™t guess, test it.
* Added complexity has a long-term costs that should be considered.
