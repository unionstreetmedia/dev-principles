# Union Street Media Engineering Principles

## Culture

- be nice to future you
- choose simple over complicated
- approach [building software as a craft](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
- value [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) over scrum/kanban/other framework

## Building Software

- use tools and libraries that are well supported in the community
- prioritize code maintainability over code duplication
- set ourselves up for frequent refactoring
- use intention revealing names
- write self documenting code
- don't leave [broken windows](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/) unrepaired

## Quality

- prioritize quality over speed | [the only way to go fast is to go well](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.VehementMediocrity)
